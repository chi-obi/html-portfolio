<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a Junior software developer focused on building practical, scalable solutions that solve real business problems. My background spans business strategy, operations, and advisory work, which gives me a strong understanding of how technology should support growth—not just exist for its own sake. I’m currently deepening my technical skills to complement my business experience and expand the range of value I can deliver through digital products, platforms, and services.</p>

<p>What drives me is intentional growth. I’m committed to continuous learning, disciplined execution, and building systems that create leverage—both professionally and personally. Learning to code is not just a career move for me; it’s a way to prove to myself that I can master complex skills independently, adapt to changing environments, and create opportunities that aren’t limited by geography or traditional structures.</p>

<p>Long term, my goal is to work remotely on meaningful projects, build sustainable ventures, and design a lifestyle that allows me to be present for the people I care about while enjoying freedom, travel, and financial stability. This site documents my journey—what I’m learning, what I’m building, and how I’m translating ideas into working solutions—one project at a time.</p>
